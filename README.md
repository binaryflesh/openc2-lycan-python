<h2><a id="purposeStatement">Statement of Purpose</a></h2>

<p>Statement of Purpose for this OASIS TC Open Repository (openc2-lycan-python) as <a href="https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/openc2/201802/msg00006.html">proposed</a> and <a href="https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/openc2/201803/msg00007.html">approved</a> [<a href="https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/openc2/201803/msg00023.html">bis</a>] by the TC:</p>

<p>The purpose of this OASIS TC Open repository is to develop and maintain a python implementation of <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/">OpenC2</a>, and to provide a python codebase to facilitate other prototype efforts.  The python library is designed to support transformations between data-interchange formats (such as JSON) and python language objects.</p>

<p>The OASIS OpenC2 Technical Committee was <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/openc2/charter.php">chartered</a> to address matters as they pertain to command and control of cyber defense technologies, and to maintain a library of prototype implementations.</p>
